# noteapp


An application built with the idea of storing notes from audio commands for Full-Stack AI project.

This application will utilize Docker, an Angular front end, websockets for the backend, and MySQL for the database. 

 ## README UPDATE ONE

1. Basic back end features exist now, a user can become a journalist, subscribe to journal subjects, and add notes to them.
2. Basic testing and exception handling in place.
3. Docker works and doesn't. There is some issue with accessing the database when the app is ran in a container? idk. 
4. The database works though, so for now I will continue using MySQL but I will not run the actual application in docker.
5. Up next is fleshing out the backend, I want to cover any possible exceptions with events and have deeper testing.
